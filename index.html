        <h4>Art can be found all around you. It exists naturally and independently, despite the popular belief that people are responsable for bringing it to the physical world by exploiting a rare God-given talent.<br/>Art is an individual organism, a living energy, in the existance of which human beings are only involved as hosts, as pipe-lines that allow its power to travel through.<br/>However, we must not neglect the valuable role owned by an artist, their unique way of connecting to such a graceful, also abstract, entity, their capacity of giving birth to Beauty and Thoughtful Depth into Earth.<br/>But what exactly comes into your mind when hearing a strong word like ART? And what do you understand by the concept of an ARTIST? Let us clear things up a bit!</h4>

        <div class="left"><img alt="img3" src="Dze3PxyWkAAUDBL.jpg"/><p><br/><br/><br/>Furthermore, we should also learn how to spot the difference between an offensive act of vandalism and an unannounced innovation of our street image as a result of artistic activities.</p></div>

But let us analyse a little how did every single known culture on earth manage to survive and preserve its stories, traditions and beleiefs if not through the creation of what we could call today painters' parents?</p></div>

Sometimes, all you have to keep near is your own body (of course, for a tattoo, a needle would be useful too).</p>
