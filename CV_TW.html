    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>
            A current student, who has just finished their second year in the favorable situation of getting
considerably high grades (most of them above 9) and owning a lot of theoretical knowledge
regarding Mathematics and Informatics, since studying the both subjects in order to obtain a
double degree.

            Bucharest 2017-present</h3>
            <p>Since applying to the Mathematics program (not the Informatics one) provided by The Faculty
of Mathematics and Informatics, the first year of university founded the basis of the primordial
mathematical subjects like Analysis, Algebra, Geometry and Logic, to the background of which
also contributed a slight intervention of programming introduction, present in courses like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Procedural Programming;</li>
                    <li>Algorithmic Graph Theory;</li>
                    <li>Matlab - Introduction in mathematical software.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Following the desire to possess more information about the field of Computer Science, I took the
opportunity of double specialization, a studying profile that allows me to acquire two different
degrees (one in Mathematics, one in Informatics) by assigning me to both programs’ courses.
Once registered for this profile, not only I was able to follow classes like Measure Theory, Probability
or Differential Equations, but I did also study Programming on a greater level with the support of
the courses I am going to mention:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object Oriented Programming;</li>
                    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms;</li>
                    <li>Databases;</li>
                    <li>Formal Languages and Automata Theory;</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems;</li>
                    <li>CPU Architecture.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Beside the theoretical concepts and scientific topics these classes exposed, what truly built my
view of an actual programmer’s work was the amount of coding projects I had been involved in
throughout the semester (see the link to my GitHub account attached to the Links Section).</p>

            Bucharest 2013–2017</h3>
            <p>During high school my main concern consisted of multilateral education and profound development
of intellectual property regarding various research areas made available to me by my highly
responsible teachers. Aiming to excel in a diversity of domains, I preferred to solidify and expand
a serious general knowledge instead of focusing on a certain class, which made it difficult to
choose one further path. Eventually, I discovered that amplifying my didactic endowment through
an exact science faculty would not set limits to my personal artistic and humanistic heritage. I
managed to pass the national Baccalaureate exams in 2017 with the following grades:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mathematics (M1): 10</li>
                    <li>Informatics: 9.60</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
